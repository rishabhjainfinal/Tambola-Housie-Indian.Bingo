**cost of chits seperatly ~₹250 and you will get only 1800 chits,
with my code you can generate ∞(infinite) numbers of chits in some sec depends on your computer speed**

so from the numbers and one time chits which is equavelent to one box we save about **₹750 ~ $9.78**
adding the generation of chits for free it upto you how many chits you can produce lets make a round of **₹2000 **


**so from this project we save about ₹3000 ~ $40**
